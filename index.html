<h1>Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want</h1>
  <h2>The Smiths - Hatful of Hollow</h2>
  
  <p> Good times for a change
    <br>See, the luck I've had
    <br>Can make a good man
    <br> Turn bad
  </p>
  
    <p>So please, please, please
    <br> Let me, let me, let me
    <br> Let me get what I want 
    <br> This time
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Haven't had a dream in a long time
    <br> See, the life I've had
    <br> Can make a good man turn bad
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So for once in my life
    <br> Let me get what I want
    <br> Lord knows, it would be the first time
    <br> Lord knows, it would be the first time
  </p>
